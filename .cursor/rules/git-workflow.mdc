This project uses Github project management. Use the `gh` CLI to review and work on issues:

- List open issues: `gh issue list`
- View issue details: `gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER>`
- Create a branch to work on an issue: `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER>`
- Switch to the issue branch: `git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>`
- Stage and commit work: `git add .`, `git commit -m "explanation of change"`, `git push`
- Open a PR: `gh pr create -t "Explanation of change"`

As much as possible, a PR should be scoped to a single issue. If you want to make changes outside of the issue scope, open a new issue and commit them to a new issue branch.
